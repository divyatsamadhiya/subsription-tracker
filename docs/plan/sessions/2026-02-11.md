# Planning Session - 2026-02-11

## Summary

This session pivoted the project from a local-only architecture to a separated frontend/backend model with account-backed persistence.

## Decisions Confirmed

1. Repository split into `frontend` and `backend`.
2. Backend stack: Express.js + MongoDB.
3. Auth model: email/password + JWT in HTTP-only cookie.
4. API pattern: REST under `/api/v1`.
5. Runtime mode: online-first.
6. Cutover model: fresh start (no automatic Dexie migration).
7. Scope requirement: preserve current user-facing feature set while switching persistence layer.

## Implementation Notes

- Backend and frontend contracts are maintained independently in each app.
- Frontend store replaced IndexedDB persistence with API calls.
- Backend routes added for auth, subscriptions, settings, and backup import/export.
- Docs updated to reflect architecture, scope, and roadmap changes.

## Risks and Follow-ups

1. Backend dependencies must be installed before backend build/start commands can run.
2. Auth hardening (password reset, MFA, token rotation) remains future scope.
3. Online-first behavior reduces offline data editing capability.
