# Planning Session - 2026-02-08

## Summary

This session defined the initial product direction and technical baseline for a new free subscription tracker. The app will start as a local-first Web PWA with no login and no backend.

## Decisions Confirmed

1. Platform: Web PWA first.
2. Scope: Core MVP only.
3. Reminders: Optional local reminders with realistic web constraints, plus `.ics` fallback.
4. Backup strategy: Manual JSON import/export.
5. Currency model: Single app-wide default currency.
6. Auth/backend: None in V1.
7. Planning documentation: Persist in `docs/plan/`.

## Open Risks

1. Browser notification behavior differs by platform and may not fire reliably when app is inactive.
2. Without cloud sync, cross-device continuity depends entirely on manual backup/import discipline.
3. Date/cycle calculations (month boundaries, leap years, timezone shifts) require strong test coverage.
