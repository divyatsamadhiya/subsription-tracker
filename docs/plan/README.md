## Planning Rules

- Update topic docs (`product-brief.md`, `mvp-scope.md`, `architecture.md`, `roadmap.md`) when the active plan changes.
- Append each meaningful architecture/product decision to `decision-log.md`.
- Add dated `sessions/` notes to preserve decision history.
- Keep topic docs as current source of truth; use session notes as context snapshots.
