## Planning Rules

- Update topic docs (`product-brief.md`, `mvp-scope.md`, `architecture.md`, `roadmap.md`) when the latest agreed plan changes.
- Append every meaningful decision to `decision-log.md` using the standard date/decision/rationale/impact format.
- Add a dated file under `sessions/` for each planning conversation to preserve historical context.
- Keep topic docs as the latest source of truth and use session notes as historical snapshots.
